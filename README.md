This is an assignment from Stanford CS106X course
This is a yes/no guessing game called "20 Question." The human player can start by choosing an input file for the questions to be aksed. Then the player think of an object, and answer the questions accordingly by typing "y" for "yes" and "n" for "no." The game program will check if it has made an accurate prediction on the object the user thought of.
